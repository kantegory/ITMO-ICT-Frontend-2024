                <hr>
                <p> Join us to learn how to do some of the best gym warm-ups for a powerful and productive gym session with pro trainer Corey Ashe. <br> When learning how to warm up in the gym, don’t overexert yourself. The warmup is not where you want to extend all your energy.
                    You should warm up for 5-10 minutes before diving into your workout. The warmup created by Ashe is full-body and dynamic. Dynamic exercises are controlled movements that prep your muscles for peak performance.
                    Ashe explained that dynamic movements are best to do before training or games. These movements mimic the exact movements you will be making in your workout or sport.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Increase your hip mobility in this commonly tight area to experience more flexibility and comfort in your everyday life. <br>
                    Follow along as Dave Connor, a professional trainer at the adidas gym walks you through 10 essential hip stretches and exercises to improve your mobility. <br>
                    Learning how to improve your hip mobility may seem daunting if this is a perpetually tight area for you. Many people suffer from stiff and inflexible hips due to sitting for extended periods and getting a little exercise. <br>
                    "Lack of movement causes poor hip mobility," said Connor. "Whether that means sitting or standing at your desk all day, regardless, it is not moving enough in various positions." You can work to increase your hip mobility by incorporating the ten strength and flexibility exercises featured in this video into your fitness routine.

                <hr>
                <p>To continue training to be a great baseball or softball player, first you need to avoid getting injured. These baseball conditioning drills and workouts train for explosive movement, lateral power, and strength and integrity of your core, glutes, hamstrings, and arms. <br>
                    Training team deficits to become stronger as a whole is top of mind for the Miami Hurricanes’ Strength and Conditioning Coach, H.R. Powell. Powell’s set of seven baseball workouts target key areas that players routinely use during a game no matter their position. <br>
                    In the off-season and pre-season, Powell recommends amping up your strength conditioning. Once the season starts, he shifts his focus to maintaining strength, range of motion and full-body recovery between games.</p>
